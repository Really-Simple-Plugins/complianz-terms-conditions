### Additional Data
`.po` file are _very_ helpful here. We're a unique project, crossing potentially hundreds of languages, and no one contributor
will be able to master all of them. That's where _you_ come in! As the expert in your languages, you have the best perspective on
what is going wrong. Your `.po` files are often the best window for all of us into the issue you're having, so try to include them
if you can.
